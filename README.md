This project demonstrates the **Command Design Pattern** using a simple **Remote Control and Light** example in C#.

The Command pattern turns a **request into an object**, allowing you to **parameterize**, **queue**, and **undo** operations ‚Äî all without tightly coupling the sender (Invoker) and the receiver (the actual performer of the action).

## üß© How It Works

1. **ICommand** ‚Äì Defines the common interface for all commands, including `Execute()` and `Undo()`.  
2. **Light** ‚Äì The **Receiver**, which knows how to perform the actual actions (turning on or off).  
3. **TurnOnLightCommand** / **TurnOffLightCommand** ‚Äì The **ConcreteCommand** classes that call specific methods on the receiver.  
4. **RemoteControl** ‚Äì The **Invoker** that triggers the commands and can also undo them.  
5. **Program (Client)** ‚Äì The entry point that sets everything up and demonstrates executing and undoing commands.

## üöÄ Key Takeaways

- Decouples **Invoker** (the requester) from the **Receiver** (the executor).  
- Makes it easy to **add new commands** without changing existing code.  
- Supports **undo/redo functionality** with simple history tracking.  
- Great for scenarios like **remote controls, GUIs, macros, and transactional systems**.
